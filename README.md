This is my code for TuringTech - Backend technical test (Intermediate). The app is in typescript and nest js. This implements the feature of call forwarding using Twilio' Api's. 1 is for forwarding call to a number which is saved in .env file outside the src directory. 2 is to leave a voicemail which twilio stores internally and provides with a link. I created 2 modules, twilio that handles the functionality related to the APIs and the IVR logic of where the call to be forwarded. The call module handles all the endpoints and communication with a database that stores call id, caller cell phone, caller response(1 or 2), call state and recordings url(if its a voicemail). There is also a docker-compose file that I used for creating a postgres database whose credentials are also present in .env file previously mentioned. The call ends with a goodbye note.
